# STATEMENT OF RESEARCH
Tenure-track Faculty Position: Energy Systems Engineering, Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College.

## Research Philosophy
The single best descriptor for my area of research is Energy Systems Engineering. In the spirit of Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering at large, and this faculty position in particular, my research is truly interdisciplinary -- part mechanical engineering, part environmental engineering, part power systems engineering, part industrial ecology, part data analysis and part statistical modeling. My research calls upon a solid foundation in Mechanical Engineering (University of Maryland, B.S. 2009), coupled with interdisciplinary training in Civil & Environmental Engineering (University of Colorado Denver, M.S. 2011; Ph.D. 2014), and postdoctoral experience in Energy Systems Analysis (Sustainable Engineering Lab of Columbia University, 2014-Present). Currently, I hold a joint appointment at Columbia University as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in Mechanical Engineering and part-time Lecturer in Statistics. Each of these distinct roles has offered incredible opportunities for growth, exploration and professional development.

Across multiple projects, I strive to produce timely, salient, accessible, and most importantly, rigorous and reproducible research. I am guided by what I believe are crucial (and solvable) global sustainability challenges. I am more interested in where the rubber-meets-the-road than pie-in-the-sky, while being fully committed to transformative and forward-looking ideas. My research is emprical and analytical at heart. I believe in "big data" and statistical models as powerful analytic tools, but recognize that they alone cannot ask the "big questions". Asking the right questions requires subject-matter expertise, experience, critical thinking and a systems-perspective. My research always begins with a question, and identifies an apporpriate methodology second. This may seem obvoius to those trained in the scientific method, but is often forgotten in a rush to use the lastest and greatest technology or technique -- a temptation I know all too well given my natural curiousiy and insatiable appetitie for continued learning and maintaining a razor-sharp skill set. In just the past year, I have taught myself a new programming language, new data analysis techniques, new data visualization tools, and joined the open-source global research community on github where I make my work available to encourage real-time collaboration and feedback.  All this while producing peer-reviewed journal articles, developing curriculum for two graduate programs, building a 5-person research team, teaching a large graduate course and directing two Masters theses.

In government and industry, I have contributed research and analysis (including three publications) to the World Bank, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Presidential Climate Action Project (PCAP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). I am also a former Fulbright Scholar and National Science Foundation IGERT Fellow.

## Current Research
### Global Trends in Urban Energy Use
Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing cities--from Karachi (pop. 14 million; 34.6% increase from 2000-2010) to Delhi (22m; 39.4%), Dhaka (15m, 45.2%), Jakarta (10m; 14.8%), Bangkok (8m, 29.1%), Lagos (11m; 48.2%) and Kinshasa (9m, 55.4%)--are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with tropical to sub-tropical climates unlike those of most OECD-member cities in the global North. As the tropics/sub-tropics become increasingly urban, industrial and affluent, it is important to consider how energy demand--particularly for thermal comfort--will evolve differently in these places than it has historically across the OECD. 

To illustrate the potential for vast differences in energy demand for thermal comfort between cities in the global North and cities in the Tropics/Sub-Tropics, consider Delhi, India.  Delhi with its massive population and very hot climate is an outlier compared to most OECD cities but typical of South Asia: Peak summer temperatures routinely exceed 40 deg C. (104 F.), and intense heatwaves can approach 50 deg C. (122 F.). Given the huge temperature differential between outdoor (say 104 F.) and desired indoor air temperature (say 72 F), and the thermodynamic fact that energy for cooling scales linearly with the temperature differential, cooling a room in Delhi requires twice as much energy as cooling a room in New York where the summer outdoor-indoor temperature differential is typically half that. 

In addition to higher temperatures, the summer season is also much longer: in the past year, Delhi had over six times as many cooling-degree days as New York City (again assuming a desired indoor air temperature of 72 deg F). Compounded by leaky building envelopes in developing world cities (designed for natural ventilation, not air conditiong), intense heat-island effects (typically less green space), and massive population growth, peak electricity demand in cities thourought the developing world could one day surpass that of their neighbors to the north--not only in aggregate terms because of their population, but also *per-capita* due to climate, building design and thermodynamics. 

If we consider the trajectory of developing world cities as reaching eventual parity with OECD cities, and if we think in terms of energy *service provision* rather than just BTU or KWh, then we begin to appreciate the magnitude of future energy demand (and associated resource consumption and environmental impact). This has important implications not only for regional grid planning and supply reliability, but also the global transition to renewable energy given the limitations of meeting such large and 'peaky' demand with non-dispatchable resources such as wind and solar.


### Temporal Downscaling of the Mid-to Long-Range Energy Forecasts
Widely cited global energy forecasts such as the annual IEA World Energy Outlook inform energy planning at the highest levels of government and industry. These reports directly inform investment decisions that will shape the energy landscape for decades to come. However, such mid- to long-range demand forecasts are typically reported as annual totals and provide little insight to temporal distribution throughout the year. This leaves a huge gap in investment decisions, particularly in the power sector where demand is highly non-uniform, growth in rapidly developing economies is non-linear, and cost is driven by capital expenditures, which are in turn driven by peak demand.  Peak electrical demand for a given grid-region may represent just a few days of the year, meaning that capital utilization is low and return on investment is slow. Thus accurate long-range peak power demand forecasts are essential to proper investment decisions today.  This is particulary true for renewable energy, where utilization rates are already low due to non-dispatchability. To address this shortcoming, I am leading a study of diurnal and seasonal patterns of energy demand for a large number of global cities. This requires more and better data than is typically available to researchers, which I have cultivated through a large network of electricity grid operators in the developing world. Data continues to pour in and analyses are strengthened.  This will be a key area of continued research in 2016 and beyond.

### Disparities in Energy Access, Reliability and Consumption in Emerging Megacities
In 2006, the United Nations Development Programme, the UN Millennium Project, and the World Bank issued a joint statement:

> The world has an unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of billions of people
> by meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the international community’s time-bound 
> and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many forms. [...]
> A common finding of the ten Task Forces of the UN Millennium Project has been the urgent need
> to improve access to energy services as essential inputs for meeting each MDG. 
> Without increased investment in the energy sector, the MDGs will not be achieved in the poorest countries 
> - Energy and the Millennium Development Goals (Modi et al. 2006).

Today, significant progress has been made in improving energy access in the world's poorest countries. Yet there is still far to go. One critical yet often under-appreciated area of much-needed progress is in places <i>with</i> nominal access to modern energy services but high localized variability and disparity. This is phenomena is particularly acute in developing world mega-cities where the difference between rich and poor is tragically stark.

While the urban-rural divide in energy access is well known -- with multiple studies citing that urban residents have, on average, higher per-capita energy use than their rural counterparts (Pachauri 2004, Pauchauri and Spreng 2004, Chavez et al. 2012) -- averages do not tell the full story.

Pachauri (2004) demonstrates within-group variation by computing quantiles of per capita energy requirements for urban and rural households using micro-survey data. Pachauri finds similar levels of total direct energy use for the bottom 40 percentile of urban and rural households based on household expenditures. However, similarities dissipate at higher expenditure levels, with the top 10 percentile of urban households consuming on average 38% more end-use energy than the top 10 percentile of rural households. Our study builds on Pachauri's findings by drilling deeper for one city using high resolution observational data (as opposed to survey data). We expect to find much larger disparities between high-income and low-income (and especially informal) urban neighborhoods than previously observed.


Urban-urban disparities are acute in developing-world mega-cities, which bear the weight of massive -- and growing -- populations. Public infrastructure and essential city services are often lacking to begin with, and are further overwhelmed by the constant influx of rural-to-urban migration.

This study will investigate neighborhood-level disparities in energy access, reliability and consumption for Delhi, India. All three elements -- access, reliability and consumption -- are necessary for achieving the (now over-due) ten-year Millennium Development Goals (MDG), and the current Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) including the ambitious Sustainable Energy For All (SE4ALL) 2030 initiative. SE4ALL vows to:
  	* Ensure universal access to modern energy services.
		* Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
		* Double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

This study will help inform the debate of how to reach these ambitious targets by providing an accurate baseline for an important harbinger city (Delhi).


### Water-Energy-Climate Nexus
Water and energy infrastructure are at the core of modern cities.  They provide essential inputs to nearly every sector of the economy and shape the way we eat, live, move and conduct business in the modern world.  Water and energy infrastructure are also deeply interconnected.  For example, heat wave or drought can lead to partial or full de-rating of regional power plants due to cooling water constraints (see Fleischauer 2010, Elash 2007, Kruse et al 2004), jeopardizing critical city services that rely on electricity including potable water delivery, wastewater treatment, building ventilation, traffic lights, IT communication and medical care (see Yardley and Harris 2012, Mukherji et al 2012). 

Despite a growing body of academic literature on the relationship between water and energy (e.g. Chiu et al 2009, Wu et al 2009, Fthenakis and Kim 2010, Dominguez-Fauz et al 2009, Sovacool and Sovacool 2009, Mileke et al 2010), as well as attention from government and business (e.g. Macknick et al 2011, NETL 2009, Soeder and Kappel 2009; Coca Cola Company 2010, Chesapeake Energy 2011), water-energy conflicts persist and are on the rise throughout the U.S. and globally (Healy 2012, Caputo 2009, Land & Water Fund 2003). This motivates the need for a systems framework that can identify, quantify and compare water-energy interdependencies across sectors and across spatial and temporal domains to inform policy actors, infrastructure designer/operators and end-users who can take action to mitigate risk in cities worldwide. 

### Contributions to the Study of the Water-Energy-Climate Nexus
For my PhD, I co-developed with my advisor (Dr. Anu Ramaswami) an infrastructure-based water footprint for city energy systems. This goal of the footprint is to identify and quantify key flows of real and embodied water in urban energy systems.  Our methodology addresses the fact that provision of energy services to a city are made possible by the use of water elsewhere (often outside jurisdictional and hydrological boundaries of the city and watershed, respectively). 

Traditionally defined water footprints (e.g Gerbens-Leenes et al 2008, Hoekstra and Chapagain 2007a/b, Hoekstra and Hung 2002/2005) allocate consumptive water use due to evapo-transpiration and pollution assimilation to final economic consumption of agricultural and commercial goods.  This consumption-based perspective informs consumers of the impact of their consumption patterns, but does not address production constraints.  For example, insufficient streamflow (supply) could inhibit water withdrawals (demand) in the production of goods in the first place.  Acknowledging the importance of a production-based perspective, a team from Carnegie Mellon (Blackhurst, Hendrickson, and Sels I Vidal), computed water withdrawal intensity factors for the production of goods and services in the U.S. economy.  In a resulting paper, Blackhurst et al (2009) demonstrated that for 93% of U.S. industrial sectors, supply chain water withdrawals exceed direct withdrawals.  Building on their insights, and to address the challenge of downscaling (e.g. for city- or regional-scale analysis where national-average water withdrawal factors often do no hold true due to infrastructural and/or climatic differences), we proposed an infrastructure-based supply chain water footprint specifically designed for estimating the water withdrawal needs of city energy systems (a niche but salient topic).  

The current direction of my research in coupled water-energy footprint analysis is to translate water resource constraints to infrastructure at multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g. stochastic variation in daily available streamflow, persistent wet/dry spells, seasonal and multi-year droughts, and decadal shifts in the mean hydrologic condition due to climate change) in terms of measurable impacts to urban populations. 

The July 2012 cascading power failure in Northern India that left 600 million people without electricity for over two days was a prime example of how cities, their populations and economies are at risk to multiple and multi-scale water-energy-climate interactions.  In the case of India’s blackout, reports suggest that hot, dry conditions characteristic of the pre-monsoon season persisted further into summer than usual and remain unabated due to the late arrival of the annual monsoon.  This lead to increased demand for electricity for groundwater pumping and air conditioning (adaptive responses to hot, dry conditions) exacerbated by reductions in hydropower capacity (also linked to the delayed monsoon), resulting in grid imbalance, and ultimately, the largest blackout in human history (Mukherji et. al. 2012, Yardley and Harris 2012).  At present, seldom few city governments, policy actors or infrastructure designer/operators consider these types of trans-boundary resource constraints and/or non-stationary climate impacts to critical urban infrastructure.  Filling that gap is a key goal of this research.

### Connecting to Carnegie Mellon: Synergies and Opportunities
My work to-date (as described above) on infrastructure risk assessment at the water-energy-climate nexus has revealed several timely and policy-relevant research questions with strong intellectual merit that can form the basis of a significantly funded extramural research program as an Assistant Professor of Energy Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I believe this topic is ripe for continued research and presents many exciting opportunities for collaboration with other civil and environmental engineering faculty.  In particular, my research shares pedagogical, theoretical and methodological roots with the Green Design Institute; being firmly rooted in the traditions of interdisciplinary research, life-cycle analysis, environmental footprints and sustainable infrastructure.  It would an honor to work with department faculty affiliated with the Green Design Institute on any number of current initiatives including Sustainable Infrastructure, Energy and Environment, Life Cycle Assessment, The Laboratory for Carbon Footprinting and the Design Decisions Laboratory. 

## Teaching
In addition to building an active research program, I believe I am qualified to teach a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses including:
•  Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering
•	Introduction to Computer Application in Civil and Environmental Engineering
•	Civil Environmental Engineering Projects
•	Engineering Economics
•	Introduction to Sustainable Engineering
•	Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering Design
•	Environmental Life Cycle Assessment
•	Sustainable Engineering Project
•	Energy and the Environment

Given adequate time and resources I could also teach:
•	Probability and Estimation Methods for Engineering Systems

New courses or modules that may be of interest to the department that I could teach include: 
•	Carbon/water/environmental footprints 
•	Data analysis for engineers using the statistical package R.

While my academic teaching experience to date is limited, I bring unique experience as an outdoor educator—teaching leadership, environmental conservation, technical outdoors skills, regional flora/fauna and environmental history in a wilderness context.  While the topics may differ from those of Civil and Environmental Engineering, many of the underlying principles and techniques hold true.  I will also have a unique opportunity over the next 7 months to guest-lecture as a Fulbright-Nehru Student Scholar at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), based in New Delhi, India.  In addition to conducting research, I have been invited to co-teach a module on “cross-cutting infrastructure challenges in Delhi”, with potential for additional teaching opportunities in the spring semester.   

## Dedication, Leadership and Academic Excellence
Throughout my graduate career I have demonstrated academic excellence with consistently high marks, one peer-reviewed publication with a second recently accepted, a published book subchapter, two oral platform presentations at international conferences, and funding from multiple National Science Foundation grants, the U.S. State Department, and the United States-India Educational Foundation.  I also played an active role in securing grant funding, with contributions to strategic planning and writing for several large, interdisciplinary proposals including NSF-PIRE (awarded), NSF-RCN (awarded), NSF-SRN (finalist), NSF-SEP, NSF-WCS, and NSF-IGERT.

As an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, College Park, I earned recognition for leadership and dedication to service through my work with the international humanitarian organization Engineers without Borders (EWB). Over the course of four years I served as EWB-University of Maryland chapter President, Vice President, and three-time Project Leader.  In these roles, I helped bring together university, government, non-profit and private-sector resources to design, build and support community-driven sustainable infrastructure projects in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Thailand.  

In addition to academic and humanitarian work, I have contributed to research efforts at two national laboratories and one non-profit organization.  Most notably, I contributed to a widely cited LCA meta-analysis and harmonization project at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) that went on to be published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a special report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (Summary for Policymakers, 2011).  Prior to that, I contributed research and analysis on national carbon-mitigation strategies for the Presidential Climate Action Project (PCAP), which provides recommendations to the President of the United States on how to address anthropogenic climate change under executive authority.  I have also held research assignments/internships at the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Policy and International Affairs where I studied fossil fuel displacement potential of domestic biofuels, and investigated fossil fuel price manipulation in U.S. commodity futures trading markets; and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Buildings and Fire Research Laboratory where I worked on indoor air quality monitoring.  

In sum, I believe my breadth of knowledge spanning renewable and non-renewable electricity generating technologies, conventional and unconventional fuel cycles, biofuel production pathways, U.S. energy policy, the water-energy-climate nexus, environmental life-cycle assessment, industrial ecology, urban metabolism and sustainable infrastructure systems, makes me a well-rounded candidate for Assistant Professor of Energy Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.  The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon offers unparalleled opportunities for collaboration, interdisciplinary research, intellectual growth, and continued learning—opportunities that I deeply value and would strive to cultivate in my students and myself.  

Thank you for considering my application and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Elliot Cohen
