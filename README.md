Ecohen4 is the github handle for Elliot Cohen.

Elliot Cohen earned his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the Sustainable Urban Infrastructure program at the University of Colorado-Denver. His work combines theory and practice from mechanical engineering, civil engineering, industrial ecology, sustainable energy systems and statistical modeling to explore the dynamic relationship between energy and water, and its implications for future energy development.  

Elliot has contributed research to the World Bank, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Presidential Climate Action Project (PCAP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Elliot is a former Fulbright Scholar, National Science Foundation IGERT Fellow and currently, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Earth Institute of Columbia University. At the Earth Institute, Elliot works with the Sustainable Engineering Lab to tackle grid-scale renewable energy integration and improve environmental performance of other large-scale engineered infrastructures, particularly in a development context.
