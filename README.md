Ecohen4 is the github handle for Elliot Cohen; You can reach him at <elliot.umd@gmail.com>.

## Bio
Elliot currently works as a data scientist at a clean-tech startup based in Boulder, CO. He specializes in predictive modeling of residential energy consumption and the development of utility-scale energy efficiency and demand response programs. Elliot leverages machine learning and statistical analysis for fast, scalable and reproducible results. He is fluent in Python and R, and writes production-caliber energy intelligence software. 

Prior to joining the private sector in 2015, Elliot taught data analytics and visualization at Columbia University in New York City. He has also taught data analytics internationally, including to energy professionals in West Africa with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Before joining Columbia University as an Earth Institute Fellow and Lecturer in the Department of Statistics, Elliot earned a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Colorado at Denver. His dissertation research focused on identifying and quantifying supply-chain risks to grid-scale energy systems in the US and India.

Cumulatively, Elliot has over 8 years of post-baccalaureate experience in the energy sector, and has published research for some of the most prominent organizations in his field, including the World Bank, the United Nations, the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Lab, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He is also a former Fulbright Scholar and Fellow of Columbia University and the National Science Foundation. 

## Teaching
Elliot taught data visualization for the graduate program in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (ISERP) at Columbia University. 

His course offered a rigorous introduction to data visualization from theory to implementation. Drawing on a combination of lectures, readings, discussions and coding, students translated the timeless concepts of Minard, Playfair, Tufte and Wilkinson to new and diverse fields of study. Students received a coding crash-course in `R`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `HTML` and `D3`. The overarching course objective was to build the requisite foundation for modern implementation of the grammar of graphics.

In August 2014, Elliot co-taught a workshop on data analytics for energy professionals in West Africa. The workshop was jointly funded by the ECOWAS Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (ECREEE) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

Beyond science and engineering, Elliot has unique training in pedagogy as an outdoor educator -- teaching leadership, environmental conservation, technical outdoors skills, regional flora/fauna and history in rugged wilderness classrooms.

## Previous Work
Here are links to several large, collaborative projects Elliot has contributed to in former positions at the Earth Institute of Columbia University, the World Bank, the National Renewable Energy Lab and the Presidential Climate Action Project.
