## Research Philosophy
The best descriptor for my area of expertise is Energy Systems Engineering. Commensurate with the philosophy of Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering, my research is truly interdisciplinary -- part mechanical engineering, part environmental engineering, part systems engineering, part data analysis and part statistics. My research calls upon:

* A solid foundation in **mechanical engineering** (B.S. 2009, University of Maryland)
* Interdisciplinary training in **sustainable urban infrastructure** (M.S. 2011, University of Colorado Denver)
* Fluency with statistical and quantitative methods in **environmental engineering** (Ph.D. 2014, University of Colorado Denver)
* Extensive **fieldwork** (Fulbright Scholar to India, 2013)
* P.I. experience in **energy systems engineering** (Postdoc, 2014-Present, Columbia University) 

In terms of impact, my research extends beyond peer-reviewed journals to the desks of policy-makers in government and industry. Notably, I have contributed research and analysis to:

* **The World Bank** Cities and Climate Change: Responding to an Urgent Agenda (book)
* **National Renewable Energy Laboratory** Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Project (journal article)
* **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change** Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (IPCC report)
* **Presidential Climate Action Project** Report to the President of the United States on Addressing Climate Change Under Executive Authority (public report)
Continuing this tradition of policy-relevant and impactful externally-funded research, I am currently working in partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to train energy professionals in West Africa in energy analytics and computational methods.In the following sections, I describe four of my current research projects for which I am first author, principal investigator and/or project-lead.


## Current Research
### Global Trends in Urban Energy Use
Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing cities--from Karachi (pop. 14 million; 34.6% pop. increase from 2000-2010) to Delhi (22m; 39.4%), Dhaka (15m, 45.2%), Jakarta (10m; 14.8%), Bangkok (8m, 29.1%), Lagos (11m; 48.2%) and Kinshasa (9m, 55.4%)--are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with tropical to sub-tropical climates unlike those of most OECD-member cities in the global North. As the tropics/sub-tropics become increasingly urban, industrial and affluent, it is important to consider how energy demand--particularly for thermal comfort--will evolve differently in these places than it has historically across the OECD. 

To illustrate the potential for vast differences in energy demand for thermal comfort between cities in the global North and cities in the Tropics/Sub-Tropics, consider Delhi, India. Delhi with its massive population and very hot climate is an outlier compared to most OECD cities but typical of South Asia: Peak summer temperatures routinely exceed 40 deg C. (104 F.), and intense heatwaves can approach 50 deg C. (122 F.). Given the huge temperature differential between outdoor (say 104 F.) and desired indoor air temperature (say 72 F), and the thermodynamic fact that energy for cooling scales linearly with the temperature differential, cooling a building in Delhi requires twice as much energy as cooling a building in New York where the summer outdoor-indoor temperature differential is typically half that. 

In addition to higher temperatures, the summer season is also much longer: in the past year, Delhi had over six times as many cooling-degree days as New York City (again assuming a desired indoor air temperature of 72 deg F). Compounded by leaky building envelopes in developing world cities (designed for natural ventilation, not air conditioning), intense heat-island effects (typically less green space), and massive population growth, peak electricity demand in cities throughout the developing world could one day surpass that of their neighbors to the north--not just in aggregate terms because of their population, but also *per-capita* due to climate, building design and thermodynamics. 

If we consider the trajectory of developing world cities as reaching eventual parity with OECD cities, and if we think in terms of energy *service provision* rather than just BTU or KWh, then we begin to appreciate the magnitude of future energy demand (and associated resource consumption and environmental impact). This has important implications not only for regional grid planning and supply reliability, but also the global transition to renewable energy given the limitations of meeting such large and 'peaky' demand with non-dispatchable resources such as wind and solar.

To address this issue, I am compiling a global database of high-resolution electricity demand data for a large number of emerging mega-cities and other high-growth urban areas in the tropics and sub-tropics. Using this database (which will be the first of its kind), I am analyzing demand elasticity, climate-sensitivity of demand, cooling and heating set points, and how these change over time along the development spectrum.


### Temporal Downscaling of Long-Range Energy Forecasts
Global energy forecasts such as the much-anticipated annual IEA World Energy Outlook inform energy planning at the highest levels of government and industry. These reports directly influence investment decisions today that will lock-in carbon emissions and environmental impacts for decades to come. However, such mid- to long-range demand forecasts are typically reported as annual totals and provide little insight to the temporal distribution throughout the year. This leaves a huge gap in investment decisions, particularly in the power sector where demand is non-uniform, growth is non-linear, and cost is driven by capital expenditures, which in turn are driven by peak demand, not integral energy consumption. 

Peak electrical demand for a given grid-region may represent just a few days of the year, meaning that capital utilization is low and return on investment is long. Thus accurate long-range peak demand forecasts are essential for proper investment decisions today. This is particulary true for renewable energy, where utilization rates are already low due to non-dispatchability. 

To address this shortcoming, I am leading a study of diurnal and seasonal patterns of energy demand for a large number of global cities. This requires more and better data than is typically available to researchers, which I have cultivated through a diverse network of electricity grid operators across the developing world. Data continues to pour in, strengthening our analyses. This will be a key area of my research in 2016 and beyond.

### Disparities in Energy Access in Emerging Megacities
In 2006, the United Nations Development Programme, the UN Millennium Project, and the World Bank issued a joint statement:

> The world has an unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of billions of people
> by meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the international communityâ€™s time-bound 
> and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many forms. [...]
> A common finding of the ten Task Forces of the UN Millennium Project has been the urgent need
> to improve access to energy services as essential inputs for meeting each MDG. 
> Without increased investment in the energy sector, the MDGs will not be achieved in the poorest countries 
> (Modi et al. 2006).

Today, significant progress has been made in improving energy access in the world's poorest countries. Yet disparities remain. Two critical areas of persistent disparity are the urban-rural divide and the intra-urban divide. The urban-rural divide is well known -- with multiple studies citing that urban residents have, on average, higher per-capita energy use than their rural counterparts (Pachauri 2004, Pauchauri and Spreng 2004, Chavez et al. 2012). But averages do not tell the full story. Pachauri (2004) reveals large within-group variation in per capita energy requirements for urban and rural households using micro-survey data. He demonstrates similar levels of total direct energy use for the bottom 40 percentile of urban and rural households, but finds that similarities dissipate at higher expenditure levels. The top 10 percentile of urban households consume on average 38% more end-use energy than the top 10 percentile of rural households. This suggests larger within-group variation and higher skew in the distribution of energy services in urban compared to rural areas. Which brings us to what I call intra-urban disparities in energy access. 

Our study builds on Pachauri's findings by drilling deeper for one city using high resolution observational data (as opposed to survey data). We expect to find much larger disparities between high-income and low-income urban neighborhoods than previously documented in the literature.

We hypothesize that intra-urban disparities will be highly significant in developing-world mega-cities, which bear the weight of massive, and growing, populations. Public infrastructure and essential city services are often lacking to begin with, and are further overwhelmed by the influx of rural-to-urban migration.


### Water-Energy-Climate Nexus
For my PhD, I co-developed with my advisor (Anu Ramaswami, Chair Professor of Science, Technology and Public-Policy at the University of Minnesota) an infrastructure-based water footprint for city energy systems. The footprint serves to identify and quantify key flows of real and embodied water in urban energy systems. Our methodology addresses the fact that provision of energy services to a city are made possible by the use of water elsewhere (often outside jurisdictional and hydrological boundaries of the city and watershed, respectively). 

Traditionally defined water footprints (e.g Gerbens-Leenes et al 2008, Hoekstra and Chapagain 2007a/b, Hoekstra and Hung 2002/2005) allocate consumptive water use due to evapo-transpiration and pollution assimilation to final economic consumption of agricultural and commercial goods. This consumption-based perspective informs consumers of the impact of their consumption patterns, but does not address production constraints. For example, insufficient streamflow (supply) could inhibit water withdrawals (demand) in the production of goods in the first place.

Acknowledging the importance of a production-based perspective, Blackhurst et al. (2009) demonstrated that for 93% of U.S. industrial sectors, supply chain water withdrawals exceed direct withdrawals. Building on their insights, and to address the challenge of downscaling (e.g. for city- or regional-scale analysis where national-average water withdrawal factors often do no hold true due to infrastructural and/or climatic differences), we proposed an infrastructure-based supply chain water footprint specifically designed for estimating the water withdrawal needs of city energy systems. 

Coupled water-energy footprints make it possible to translate water resource constraints at multiple spatial and temporal scales to measurable impacts on urban populations. 

For example, the July 2012 cascading power failure in Northern India (that left 600 million people without electricity for over two days) was a prime example of how cities, their populations and economies are at risk to multiple and multi-scale water-energy-climate interactions. In this case, reports suggest that hot, dry conditions characteristic of the pre-monsoon season persisted further into summer than usual and remained unabated due to late arrival of the annual monsoon. This induced increased electricity demand for groundwater pumping and air conditioning (adaptive responses to hot, dry conditions) exacerbated by reductions in hydropower capacity (also linked to the delayed monsoon), resulting in grid imbalance, and ultimately, the largest blackout in human history (Mukherji et al. 2012, Yardley and Harris 2012). At present, seldom few city governments, policy actors or infrastructure designer/operators consider these types of trans-boundary resource constraints to critical urban infrastructure. Filling that gap is a key goal of this research.

## Connecting to Dartmouth 
In five key areas I have identified timely and policy-relevant research questions with strong intellectual merit that can form the basis of a significantly funded extramural research program as an Assistant Professor of Energy Systems Engineering. I believe these topics are ripe for continued research and present many exciting opportunities for collaboration with other engineering faculty:

* Global trends in urban energy use
* Energy forecasting and downscaling 
* Disparities in energy access
* Environmental impacts of renewable & conventional energy technologies, and
* Water-energy-climate nexus

This portfolio of research will strengthen Dartmouth's commitment to sustainable energy. In particular, my work would be a natural fit for the Thayer School's Sustainable Environmental Decisions Group.  

It would an honor to join an engineering department steeped in nearly 150 years of tradition that is as forward-looking today as it was at its founding.
