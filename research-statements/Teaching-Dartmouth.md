## Teaching Interests
In addition to building an active research program, I believe I am qualified to teach a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses. Specialties denoted in **bold**:

### Undergraduate

*  **Introduction to Scientific Computing (with R)**
*  Introduction to Engineering
*  Introduction to Thermodynamics
*  Discrete and Probabilistic Systems
*  **Introduction to Environmental Engineering**
*  Environmental Transport and Fate
*  Sustainability and Natural Resource Management
*  Statistical Methods in Engineering

### Graduate

* **Industrial Ecology**
* **Climate Change and Engineering**
* **Energy Utilization**
* **Energy Conversion**
* **Energy Systems**

### New
I would also be pleased to introduce new courses in my areas of expertise that are not currently offered at the Thayer School of Engineering:

* **Data Analysis**
* **Data Visualization**
* **Environmental Life Cycle Assessment**
* **Environmental Footrpints: Carbon, Water and Materials**

## Teaching Experience 
I currently teach **data visualization** for the graduate program in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (ISERP) at Columbia University. My academic appointment is in the Statistics Department. I co-taught this course in Fall 2014 and am the primary instructor for Spring 2015.

This course offers a rigorous introduction to data visualization from theory to implementation. Drawing on a combination of lectures, readings, discussions and coding, we translate the timeless concepts of Minard, Playfair, Tufte and Wilkinson to new and diverse fields of study. Students receive a coding crash-course in R, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and D3. The goal is not to become computer scientists, but to build the requisite foundation for modern implementation of exploratory and explanatory data visualizations. Students have the opportunity to work in small teams to create interactive data visualizations worthy of their portfolios. The final deliverable is a research-driven data visualization with accompanying prose in the form of a conference paper submission.

In addition to data visualization, I guest-lecture in Prof. Vijay Modi's mechanical engineering courses on **energy infrastructure planning** and **energy sources and conversion**. I also help develop curriculum and assignments for these courses.

In August 2014, I co-taught a workshop on **data analytics** for energy professionals in West Africa. The workshop was jointly funded by the ECOWAS Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (ECREEE) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

Beyond science and engineering, I have unique training in pedagogy as an outdoor educator -- teaching leadership, environmental conservation, technical outdoors skills, regional flora/fauna and environmental history in rugged wilderness settings.
