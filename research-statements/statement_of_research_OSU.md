## Research Experience
The best descriptor for my area of expertise is Sustainable Energy Systems. It is truly interdisciplinary -- part mechanical engineering, part environmental engineering, part sustainability science, part data analysis and part statistics. My research calls upon:

* A solid foundation in **mechanical engineering** (B.S. 2009, University of Maryland)
* Interdisciplinary training in **sustainable urban infrastructure** (M.S. 2011, University of Colorado Denver)
* Fluency with quantitative methods in **environmental engineering** (Ph.D. 2014, U. Colorado Denver)
* Extensive **fieldwork** (Fulbright Scholar to India, 2013)
* Research design and project management in **energy systems engineering** (Postdoc, 2014-Present, Columbia U.) 

In terms of impact, my research extends beyond peer-reviewed journal articles to the desks of policy-makers. Notably, I have contributed research and analysis to:

* World Bank [Cities and Climate Change: Responding to an Urgent Agenda](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2312)
* National Renewable Energy Laboratory [Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Project](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00474.x/asset/j.1530-9290.2012.00474.x.pdf?v=1&t=i4g0ctd7&s=3f642884c2f19f5fe640f41220f1296f2c777366)
* IPCC [Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation](http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Ch03.pdf)
* Presidential Climate Action Project [Report on Addressing Climate Change Under Executive Authority](http://www.climateactionproject.com/docs/PCAP_Report_2012.pdf)
Continuing a tradition of policy-relevant and impactful externally-funded research, I am currently working with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to train energy professionals in West Africa in data analytics and grid-integration of renewable energy.I am currently lead author, principle investigator and/or project-lead for five research initiatives:

* [Global Trends in Urban Energy Use](https://github.com/Ecohen4/Energy/blob/master/Global%20Trends%20in%20Urban%20Energy%20Use%20-%20Intro.PDF) with Vijay Modi, Henri Torbey, Michael Piccirelli and Yu-Tian (Columbia)
* [Disparities in Energy Access in Emerging Megacities](http://ecohen4.github.io/Delhi/) with Sou Min Sonia Lee (Columbia)* [Temporal Downscaling of Global Energy Demand Forecasts](https://github.com/Ecohen4/Energy) with Vijay Modi, Henri Torbey and Yu-Tian (Columbia)* [The Water Footprint of Urban Energy Systems](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12086/abstract) with Anu Ramaswami (Minnesota)* [Effect of Climate on Grid-Scale Electricity Supply Reliability](http://gradworks.umi.com/36/21/3621820.html) with Anu Ramaswami and Balaji Rajagopalan (Minnesota; Colorado)

## Current Research
The Sustainable Engineering Lab [SEL](http://sel.columbia.edu/) of Columbia University works directly with governments in South Asia, East Africa and West Africa to accelerate access to clean energy and improve delivery of critical services through data-driven engineering analysis and design. The lab is lead by Professor Vijay Modi, former director of Energy Services for the United Nations Millennium Villages Project. I have developed and currently lead three of the lab's initiatives: *Global Trends in Urban Energy Use*, *Temporal Downscaling of Global Energy Demand Forecasts*  and *Disparities in Energy Access*. The first is described below.

### Global Trends in Urban Energy Use
Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing cities--from Karachi to Delhi, Dhaka, Jakarta, Bangkok, Lagos and Kinshasa--are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with tropical to sub-tropical climates unlike those of most OECD-member cities in the global North. As the tropics/sub-tropics become increasingly urban, industrial and affluent, it is important to consider how energy demand--particularly for thermal comfort--will evolve differently in these places than it has historically across the OECD. 

To illustrate the potential for vast differences in energy demand for thermal comfort between cities in the global North and cities in the Tropics/Sub-Tropics, consider Delhi, India. Delhi with its massive population and very hot climate is an outlier compared to most OECD cities but typical of South Asia: Peak summer temperatures routinely exceed 40 deg C. (104 F.), and intense heatwaves can approach 50 deg C. (122 F.). Given the huge temperature differential between outdoor (say 104 F.) and desired indoor air temperature (say 72 F), and the thermodynamic fact that energy for cooling scales linearly with the temperature differential, cooling a building in Delhi requires twice as much energy as cooling a building in New York where the summer outdoor-indoor temperature differential is typically half that. 

In addition to higher temperatures, the summer season is also much longer: in the past year, Delhi had over six times as many cooling-degree days as New York City (again assuming a desired indoor air temperature of 72 deg F). Compounded by leaky building envelopes in developing world cities (designed for natural ventilation, not air conditioning), intense heat-island effects (typically less green space), and massive population growth, peak electricity demand in cities throughout the developing world could one day surpass that of their neighbors to the north--not just in aggregate terms because of their population, but also *per-capita* due to climate, building design and thermodynamics. 

This has important implications not only for regional grid planning and supply reliability, but also the global transition to renewable energy given the limitations of meeting such large and 'peaky' demand with non-dispatchable resources such as wind and solar.

To address this issue, I am compiling a global database of high-resolution electricity demand data for a large number of cities in the tropics/sub-tropics. Using this database (which will be the first of its kind), I am analyzing demand elasticity, climate-sensitivity of demand, cooling/heating thresholds, and how these evolve over time along the development spectrum.

## Connecting to Oregon State University 
In five key areas I have identified timely and policy-relevant research questions with strong intellectual merit that can form the basis of a significantly funded extramural research program as an Assistant Professor of Energy Systems at the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering. I believe these topics will only become increasingly important as the center of mass of global energy consumption, generation deployment, carbon emissions and associated upstream/downstream environmental impacts shift from the U.S. and Europe towards South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 

Furthermore, my research offers exciting opportunities for collaboration with fellow mechanical engineering faculty at MIME.  Potential areas of synergy, combining both of our areas of expertise include:

* Optimization and control (Belinda A. Batten) of multi-site wind power generation for improved effective load carrying capacity and displacement of carbon-intensive dispatchable generation.
* Increased utilization of off-shore wind energy with underwater compressed air storage (Brian Fronk)
* Increased utilization of concentrating solar thermal power with thermal energy storage (Brian Fronk)
* Supply smoothing for wind turbine micro-grids with gas-turbine backup (David L. Blunck)

All together, my forward-looking research agenda, commitment to collaboration and scholarship, project management experience, and ability to garner external resources for high-impact projects makes me an ideal addition to the MIME faculty. It would an honor to join an engineering school with over 125 years of experience that is as innovative today as it was at its founding in 1889.
