<h1>STATEMENT OF RESEARCH &amp; TEACHING</h1>

<p><strong>Elliot Cohen</strong>
Application for Assistant Professor of Sustainability Studies and Global Environmental Equity</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>The best descriptor for my area of expertise is Sustainable Energy Systems. Commensurate with the philosophy of the Rubenstein School, my research is truly interdisciplinary -- part mechanical engineering, part environmental engineering, part sustainability science, part data analysis and part statistics. My research calls upon:</p>

<ul>
<li>A solid foundation in <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> (B.S. 2009, University of Maryland)</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary training in <strong>sustainable urban infrastructure</strong> (M.S. 2011, University of Colorado Denver)</li>
<li>Fluency with statistical and quantitative methods in <strong>environmental engineering</strong> (Ph.D. 2014, University of Colorado Denver)</li>
<li>Extensive <strong>fieldwork</strong> (Fulbright Scholar to India, 2013)</li>
<li>Research design and project-lead experience in <strong>sustainable energy systems</strong> (Postdoc, 2014-Present, Columbia University)</li>
</ul>


<p>In terms of impact, my research extends beyond peer-reviewed journals and onto the desks of policy-makers. Notably, I have contributed research and analysis to:</p>

<ul>
<li>World Bank <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2312">Cities and Climate Change: Responding to an Urgent Agenda</a> (book)</li>
<li>National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00474.x/asset/j.1530-9290.2012.00474.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=i4g0ctd7&amp;s=3f642884c2f19f5fe640f41220f1296f2c777366">Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Project </a> (journal article)</li>
<li>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href="http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Ch03.pdf">Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation</a> (IPCC report)</li>
<li>Presidential Climate Action Project <a href="http://www.climateactionproject.com/docs/PCAP_Report_2012.pdf">Report to the President of the United States on Addressing Climate Change Under Executive Authority </a> (report)</li>
</ul>


<p>Continuing this tradition of policy-relevant and impactful externally-funded research, I am currently working with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to train energy professionals in West Africa in data analytics and grid-integration of renewable energy.</p>

<p>I am currently lead author, principle investigator and/or project-lead for four research initiatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ecohen4.github.io/Delhi/">Disparities in Energy Access in Emerging Megacities</a> with Sou Min Sonia Lee (Columbia University)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ecohen4/Energy/blob/master/Global%20Trends%20in%20Urban%20Energy%20Use%20-%20Intro.PDF">Global Trends in Urban Energy Use</a> with Vijay Modi, Henri Torbey, Michael Piccirelli and Yu-Tian (Columbia University)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ecohen4/Energy">Temporal Downscaling of Global Energy Demand Forecasts</a> with Vijay Modi, Henri Torbey and Yu-Tian (Columbia University)</li>
<li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12086/abstract">The Water Footprint of Urban Energy Systems</a> with Anu Ramaswami (University of Minnesota)</li>
<li><a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/36/21/3621820.html">The Effect of Climate on Grid-Scale Electricity Supply Reliability (Ch. 6)</a> with Anu Ramaswami and Balaji Rajagopalan (University of Minnesota; University of Colorado Boulder)</li>
</ul>


<p>Given the two-page limit, links are provided above for more details regarding my current research.</p>


<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>In addition to building an active research program, I believe I am qualified to teach a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses. I would also be pleased to introduce new courses in my areas of expertise:</p>

<div class="newspaper">
<p><strong>Undergraduate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental Quantitative Analysis</li>
<li>Environmental Engineering</li>
<li>Quantitative Analysis</li>
<li>Introduction to Environmental Studies</li>
<li>International Environmental Studies</li>
<li>Sustainability Science</li>
<li>Introduction to Systems Thinking</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Graduate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Climate Change, Energy &amp; Development</li>
<li>Energy System Transitions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Industrial Ecology</li>
<li>Environmental Life Cycle Assessment</li>
<li>Environmental Footprints</li>
<li>Environmental Fate and Transport</li>
<li>Energy Sources and Conversion</li>
<li>Energy Infrastructure Planning</li>
<li>Energy, Development and Climate Change</li>
<li>Scientific Computing</li>
<li>Advanced Data Analysis</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Teaching Experience</h3>

<p>I currently teach <strong>data visualization</strong> for the graduate program in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (ISERP) at Columbia University. My academic appointment is in the Statistics Department. I co-taught this course in Fall 2014 and am the primary instructor for Spring 2015.</p>

<p>This course offers a rigorous introduction to data visualization from theory to implementation. Drawing on a combination of lectures, readings, discussions and coding, we translate the timeless concepts of Minard, Playfair, Tufte and Wilkinson to new and diverse fields of study. Students receive a coding crash-course in R, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and D3. The goal is not to become computer scientists, but to build the requisite foundation for modern implementation of exploratory and explanatory data visualizations.</p>

<p>In addition to data visualization, I guest-lecture in Prof. Vijay Modi's mechanical engineering courses on <strong>energy infrastructure planning</strong> and <strong>energy sources and conversion</strong>. I also help develop curriculum and assignments for these courses.</p>

<p>In August 2014, I co-taught a workshop on <strong>data analytics</strong> for energy professionals in West Africa. The workshop was jointly funded by the ECOWAS Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (ECREEE) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).</p>

<p>Beyond science and engineering, I have unique training in pedagogy as an outdoor educator -- teaching leadership, environmental conservation, technical outdoors skills, regional flora/fauna and environmental history in rugged wilderness settings.</p>

<h2>Connecting to The University of Vermont</h2>

<p>In five key areas I have identified timely and policy-relevant research questions with strong intellectual merit that can form the basis of a significantly funded extramural research program as an Assistant Professor of Sustainability Studies and Global Environmental Equity at the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources. I believe these topics are ripe for continued research and present many exciting opportunities for collaboration with other environmental science faculty.</p>

<p>Taken together, my research portfolio and love of teaching will strengthen the University of Vermont's commitment to world-class sustainability scholarship and education. I will help broaden and deepen RSENR faculty expertise in sustainable energy pathways and the environmental impacts of a rapidly-changing energy sector. It would an honor to join an environmental science and natural resources department with over 40 years of experience that is as innovative today as it was at its founding in 1973.</p>
